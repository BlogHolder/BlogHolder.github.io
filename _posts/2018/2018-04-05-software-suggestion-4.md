<h1>Prepare Your Content, And Let It Auto Post Itself</h1>

<p><center><u><i>Think about it for a second.</i></u></center><br>When do you post in social media? Is it when you notice you get more attraction? Or instead, it depends on at what time you are awake? The thing is, normally that "peak" moment for you might always come at the same hour, or even at a time while you are sleeping, but you would need to post at different times to know.
    <br><br>Actually, let's put it this way. You already know when you <b><i>SHOULD</i></b> be posting (let's say 4 a.m.), but you know you <b><i>CAN'T</i></b> post at that time for any reason (call it sleeping hours, work, school, etc.).
    <br><br>What <b><i>CAN</i></b> you do then? Well, luckily for us social media aficionados, <u><a href="https://hootsuite.com" target="_blank">Hootsuite</a></u> exists.
    <br><br>In a nutshell <b>Hootsuite</b> is an online scheduler that links with your social media accounts, and automates your posts for whatever time and date you program.
<br>It <b>IS</b> a subscription based program, <b>BUT</b> for small companies or individuals, the free tier it offers is more than enough (Unless you are crazy and prepare over 30 posts upfront). Nothing to lose really, so give it a try!</p>

<h2> <a href="https://hootsuite.com/" target="_blank">As Easy As It Gets</a></h2>
  <p>Using <u><a href="https://hootsuite.com" target="_blank">Hootsuite</a></u> is actually as simple as one might hope it gets:
<ol>
<li>Make your account.</li>
<li>Link your social media.</li>
<li>Prepare your posts.</li>
<li>Let them be auto-posted.</li>
</ol>
So in theory, and if you want, you can prepare a week content's upfront and let it be gradually shared as said week passes.<br><sub>Not like I do that or anything like that, hehe.</sub></p>

<hr>

<p>Hootsuite is one of those tools that you cannot go without after using it a couple of times.
<br><br>It is much simpler to prepare content you want in a single sitting, while keeping your thought train intact for whatever you are doing.
<br><br>So I hope anyone gets to use it as much as I know I do.</p>

<h3>But Regardless of What You Do With The Tool...</h3>
