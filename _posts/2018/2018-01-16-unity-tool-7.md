<h1>All In One Place</h1>

<p>When testing a game for production, it is very likely that while you are at it you have open several different folders, browser tabs, and even folders.
<br><br>And it is in Unity specifically, where one tends to visit the same folders over and over (such as <a href="https://docs.unity3d.com/ScriptReference/Application-dataPath.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Application.dataPath</a>, among others), because these are the places where you usually store save files, or points to the root of the project.
<br><br>It is specially tiresome to open repeatedly of something like <a href="https://docs.unity3d.com/ScriptReference/Application-persistentDataPath.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Application.persistentDataPath</a>, because we unconsciously closed said folder, or keep having to turn on and off hidden folders to find <a href="https://www.howtogeek.com/318177/what-is-the-appdata-folder-in-windows/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">AppData</a>. This is why this tool was created, to make your life just a little simpler.
<br><br>It is important to note that the provided standalone tool, is part of a collection that came bundled with many others from the FREE <a href="https://assetstore.unity.com/packages/tools/utilities/a-assets-explorer-free-68761" target="_blank" rel="noopener">AmLovey&#8217;s A+ Asset Explorer</a> asset.</p>
