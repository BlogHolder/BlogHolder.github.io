<h1>Never Lose Progress Again</h1>

We&#8217;ve all been there. You have been working on some scene edits for what feels like an hour, and then the moment to panic comes&#8230; <b><i>You were on runtime all along.</i></b>
<br><br>For anyone working with Unity, that is the closest to an everyday horror story. Sure, you can always change the color of the editor at runtime to notice something is different. But you can grow used to that and forget.
<br><br>This is just something that won&#8217;t let your eyes rest until you realize what you are doing.

<em><strong><u>FAIR WARNING:</u></strong></em> The message will only appear on the <em><strong>Scene Window</strong></em> (mainly to let you test on the Game Window in peace), <em><strong>when you move something</strong></em> on the scene. Meaning, that if you are just editing the values of some component on the hierarchy, it won&#8217;t trigger this <strong><em>discrete</em></strong> message.
