<h1>You Can See It, But Never Touch It</h1>

<p>When you start using Unity, the first type of &#8220;<em>customizable controls</em>&#8221; you learn to make, probably involve having a bunch of public variables to tweak during run-time to test.
<br><br>We all start like that, but if you work a little longer on a project you might realize, that <em>you make some things public just to reference them in another script,</em> <em><strong>NOT to edit them on the inspector</strong></em>.
<br><br>For example, if at runtime you get a reference to some component to cache it, you might not need the inspector to allow to change it, but you would want to see it anyway to see that it is working as intended.
<br><br>This little tool was developed with those occasions in mind.</p>

  <p>Once the attribute has been installed in your project, you can now place the attribute on top of any <em>serialized field</em> to have it permanently<strong> &#8220;locked&#8221; but view-able</strong> in your inspector:

<pre>
[ReadOnly] 
public string myString;

[ReadOnly]
[SerializeField]
private string _myOtherString;
</pre></p>
<center><a href="https://github.com/heisarzola/Unity-Development-Tools/tree/master/Attributes/Read%20Only" class="btn btn-info" target="_blank">Download it for FREE!</a></center>
</div>
<!--END OF COLUMNS-->
</div>

<p>Just keep in mind that <i>this tool only works on <b>fields</b></i>, and that <i>will not lock things in a <b>DEBUG</b> inspector</i>. But if you don&#8217;t mind that (as they are minor pet-peeves more than anything), enjoy~</p>
