  There is a point where a game cannot be placed for a lower price, as the transaction might not be worth it for the platform holder. <strong>KNIGHTS</strong> is already at that point, I CANNOT sell it cheaper. So meet me halfway? ðŸ™‚

  That will be all I wanted to say, make sure to get those deals before they are gone ðŸ™‚
