<h1>Never Forget What Your Code Does</h1>

<p>When the project you start working on keeps getting bigger, there are more and more things you will always need to remember the functionality of.
<br>Wait? Did you forget what that 500 line class you wrote was supposed to do? Well that is just a bummer, you will have to <strong>re-read it</strong> to figure out its intricacies.
<br>Or&#8230; if you want to avoid this problem altogether, you might as well just properly document what each thing is supposed to do while you make it.
<br><br>For this end, <b>Visual Studio</b> has a built-in documentation system that allows you to easily read the functionality of custom classes and methods by just commenting over them.
<br>Now, you can read your very own notes by hovering over a reference of something you wrote.</p>

  <li>Write between the &#8220;summary&#8221; tags the description of the element you are on top of.</li>
  <li>Now, whenever you make a call to that element, you can see what it does while you are typing it or by hovering your mouse over said reference.</li>

<hr>

<p>The moment I learned about this way to document your code in Visual Studio, I never stopped using it.
<br>It was especially useful whenever I was working with someone else, as this avoided us to trip over each other&#8217;s work.
<br><br>So I really hope it can become of use to someone else ðŸ™‚
