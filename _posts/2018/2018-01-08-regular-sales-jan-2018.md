  It is official, wallets are now safe (or at least safer), until the next big <em>Steam sales</em>.
</p>

<p style="text-align: center;">
  And yes, this might be too well put together to be a coincidence, so I&#8217;ll admit it now. This was all part of my evil master plan, to make you spend a couple cents:

## Head Over To The Sale

<h3 style="text-align: center;">
  PEG <del>99Â¢</del> <strong>84Â¢ </strong>â•‘ <a href="http://store.steampowered.com/app/699600/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Steam</a> | <a href="https://heisarzola.itch.io/peg" target="_blank" rel="noopener">itch.io</a>
</h3>

<p style="text-align: center;">
  From now until the 22nd <a href="http://store.steampowered.com/app/699600/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">PEG</a> is going to be on sale. And all I have to say is that if you don&#8217;t get it now, the next sales will probably be in around three months.
</p>

<p style="text-align: center;">
  However, as a little pro-tip to you, blog reader, <em>if you wait until next Monday</em>, you can <a href="http://store.steampowered.com/app/476240/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong>ALSO GET KNIGHTS ON A DISCOUNT</strong></a>!
</p>

<p style="text-align: center;">
  What is more, the bundle that contains KNIGHTS and PEG, ALSO <em><strong>STACKS WITH INDIVIDUAL DISCOUNTS</strong></em>.
</p>

<p style="text-align: center;">
  If you do get the game, hope you like it as I know many have. So thank you for your time.
