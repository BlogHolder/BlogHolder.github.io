<h1>Swiftly Organize Your Code With A Simple Command</h1>

<p>GameObjects in Unity&#8217;s hierarchy are both a charm and a curse. The distinction, relies heavily on how well you organize and break down the functionality of your game.
<br>You can esentially use GameObjects as folders, in fact, I haven&#8217;t seen a project that doesn&#8217;t do this.
<br><br>However, a minor complaint of mine was that in order to use them as a folder, I had to do the following EVERY TIME:</p>
<ol>
  <li>Create an empty GameObject.</li>
  <li>Reset that new GameObject&#8217;s transform.</li>
  <li>Reset the items to be contained within the new &#8220;folder&#8221;&#8216;s transform as well.</li>
  <li>Drag and drop them into the &#8220;folder&#8221;.</li>
</ol>
<p>Sure, they aren&#8217;t THAT many steps or too complicated for that matter, but when you do this over and over, you are just bound to mess up on those transforms.
<br>This is why this utility was created, just to save headaches down the line.</p>
