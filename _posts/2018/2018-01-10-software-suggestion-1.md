<h1>Make GIFs From Your Screen On The Press Of A Button</h1>

<p>If your everyday life somehow revolves into peeking at social media, you may have noticed that GIFs are prevalent in many popular posts. And why wouldn&#8217;t they? <em>We are immediately attracted to moving images</em> when browsing through mostly static content.
<br><br>So naturally, <em>if you want to make <strong>eye-catching posts</strong></em>, you should consider attaching <em><strong>GIFs</strong> </em>to them.
<br><br>Which is why as someone that tries to constantly create new stuff for social media, <strong><em>GIFCam</em></strong> was a blessing for my workflow.
<br><br><strong><em>GIFCam </em></strong>is a free to download and use tool that, as the name implies, allows you to record your screen and create GIFs from it. In one of the fastest, more intuitive ways to create GIFs, it is hard not to recommend it.
<br><br>(Incidentally, <em><a href="http://blog.bahraniapps.com/gifcam/#download" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong>GIFCam</strong></a> is the tool that was used to create ALL of the GIFs in the blog</em>, so yes, <em><strong>EXTRA</strong> </em>thumbs-up. :3)Â </p>

      <p>Before showing you where to get the tool, you should know <strong>it comes with a couple limitations</strong>.
<br><br>The tool already comes packed with <em>green-screen tools, size optimization algorithms, framerate recording options, etc.</em> Just note that <em><strong>you WON&#8217;T be able to add text on the fly, easily edit the recorded frames, or other meticulous operations.</strong></em> You will need another tool for those edits.
