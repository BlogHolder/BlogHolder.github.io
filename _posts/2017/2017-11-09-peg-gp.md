## PEG On The Go

Some people requested that PEG should be available on <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.heisarzola.PEG" target="_blank" rel="noopener">mobile platforms,</a> as the game is more than suited to be played on the go. Well, here you go:

Yup, the game is &#8220;premium&#8221; as didn&#8217;t wanted to bother you with last minute cheap monetization implementations such as ads. And yes, it is currently lacking in the reviews department (this soon will be intensely corrected, don&#8217;t worry).

PEG Android Port
  
Complete
  
100%

iOS port is coming, just be a little more patient, somewhat short on the money department right now, bought lots of neat stuff that will allow me to work easier. (Including a brand-new professional site)

Plus, you knew it is a 100 USD annual fee to develop for Apple? Damn, Android had a one-time $40 fee.

Better plan ahead to make it worth, but pretty sure it can pay itself with some campaigns I have in mind.

## BUT WAIT!

If you are interested on getting the game, you might be interested on getting it with an extra bonus, as the same Android version has been added to <a href="https://heisarzola.itch.io/peg" target="_blank" rel="noopener">itch.io</a>!

<a href="https://heisarzola.itch.io/peg" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-elementor-open-lightbox="default"><br /> <img src="/images/posts/2016/03/itch.png" /> </a>

Getting it there costs a little extra, but it will come to you with a <a href="http://store.steampowered.com/app/699600/PEG/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">STEAM</a> key and a discount for <a href="https://heisarzola.itch.io/knights" target="_blank" rel="noopener">KNIGHTS </a>as well if you are also interested in it! So <a href="https://itch.io/s/8960/coordinated-steam-sale-under-the-tree-puzzle-box" target="_blank" rel="noopener">take a look</a>.

## Noticed something different?

This whole post might look somewhat more professional than those in the past. Currently testing an html-like tool that seems to provide interesting results for little to no effort. If it ends up being pretty good, I might make a dedicated post about it.

## But Like Always&#8230;
