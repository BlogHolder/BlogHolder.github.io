## <a href="http://store.steampowered.com/bundle/5004/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Awesome, Cheap Minimalist Puzzle Games, At An Even Cheaper Price</a>

<a href="http://store.steampowered.com/bundle/5004/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-elementor-open-lightbox="default"><br /> <img src="/images/posts/2017/12/Minimalist-Puzzle-Developers-Bundle-Showcase.gif" /> </a>

<p style="text-align: center;">
  What you are seeing is but a small taste of a little treat that was being baked behind the scenes for <em>you guys</em>.
</p>

<p style="text-align: center;">
  <em><strong>I teamed up with other minimalist puzzle developers</strong></em> in order to present to you <em>a great deal for those interested in minimalist puzzle games</em>.
</p>

<p style="text-align: center;">
  This was done in what we called: <a href="http://store.steampowered.com/bundle/5004/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><em><strong>The Minimalist Puzzle Developers Bundle</strong></em></a>
</p>

<p style="text-align: center;">
  The bundled games are the following:
</p>

<ul style="text-align: center;">
  <li>
    Pony&#8217;s <strong><a href="http://store.steampowered.com/app/661430/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">LineWay</a></strong>.
  </li>
  <li>
    Robert Wahler&#8217;s <a href="http://store.steampowered.com/app/676420/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><em><strong>SiNKR</strong></em></a>.
  </li>
  <li>
    Konstructor&#8217;s <a href="http://store.steampowered.com/app/551110/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><em><strong>WayOut</strong></em></a>.
  </li>
  <li>
    And my very own <a href="http://store.steampowered.com/app/699600/PEG/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><em><strong>PEG</strong></em></a>.
  </li>
</ul>

<p style="text-align: center;">
  Each of the games is <strong><em>a mere 99c</em></strong>, but when you purchase them together you get an <em><strong>EXTRA 15% off!</strong></em> But guess what? Thanks to <a href="/winter-sales-2017/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">the holiday sales</a>, and until Jan. the 4th, <em><strong>you can <a href="http://store.steampowered.com/bundle/5004/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">get all of the games FOR EVEN CHEAPER</a></strong></em>!
</p>

<p style="text-align: center;">
  One normally pays more than a dollar for a coffee to go, so why not buy something to go with it? ðŸ™‚
</p>

<p style="text-align: center;">
  That is all for today, but I know that all the developers involved hope you get to enjoy the games as much as we enjoyed making them!
</p>
