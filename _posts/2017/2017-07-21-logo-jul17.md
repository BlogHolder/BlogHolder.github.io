Yup, updated and animated the logos. And already got it up and running in-engine:

<span class="embed-youtube" style="text-align:center; display: block;"></span>

It does look like a stamp right? That was the look I was going after.

Why this style though? Why not something more &#8220;gamedev-ish&#8221;? Explaining the reason would take a lot, so leave it on &#8220;because it is what I like&#8221;.

Plus not like all logos of this kind should have a controller slapped into them, in fact I don&#8217;t like them to have that.

This is but a little heads up over some of the things I&#8217;ve been working on.

So thank you for reading the short post, and for reading my blog ;D
