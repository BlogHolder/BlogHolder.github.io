Because of several reasons (top reason being I forgot my car keys in my car, with my computer in it) <a href="http://store.steampowered.com/app/699600/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">PEG</a> will be releasing on the 9th instead of the 2nd.

So better make the best out of it.

&nbsp;

**_<span style="text-decoration: underline;">Anyone interested on playing the beta version of PEG on Steam</span>_**, please go ahead and ask for a beta key to the mail <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><em><strong>contact@heisarzola.com</strong></em></span> where the same mail can be used to report any _<span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>bugs or feedback</strong></span>_.

&nbsp;

Of course, only <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong><em>one</em></strong></span> key will be given per mail, no bulks will be given out.

&nbsp;

So, looking forward for people that want to try it out early!~

Nothing but that announcement today, but looking forward for your requests.

&nbsp;

Finally, as always, a big thank you for continuing to reading my blog. Things should start getting more interesting soon ðŸ™‚
