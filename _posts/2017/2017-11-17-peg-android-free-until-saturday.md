## We did it again.

In case you missed it, <a href="/knights-gp-free/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">KNIGHTS was shortly available for free on the Google Play Store</a>.

But don&#8217;t worry, because as of today you are able to get <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.heisarzola.PEG" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong>PEG</strong></a> _COMPLETELY FREE_ instead!

In case you don&#8217;t want to play it right away, you are more than welcome to download and play it later, as free copies will _**never**_ be revoked.

## Hold on&#8230; what is a PEG?

Well, you can see it for yourself:

## Are you&#8230; reusing the last post?

Yes.

## So, in case you download and liked PEG&#8230;

Please show some love by spreading the word, _**leaving a review**_ or purchasing <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.HeIsArzola.KNIGHTS" target="_blank" rel="noopener">KNIGHTS</a>.

Not going to push anyone to do it of course, only do it if that is what you _**REALLY**_ want.

## But as always&#8230;

Thank you so so much for everything so far. This is a little thank you for your support so far, hope to keep finding ways to show my appreciation towards you guys, you rock!

But also, and as always, thank you so much for reading my blog :3
