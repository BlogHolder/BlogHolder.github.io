## It Is That Time Of The Year Again!

<p style="text-align: center;">
  Oh boy! It has been a couple of days since the sales started, so maybe you can already see that reflected in your wallet.
</p>

<p style="text-align: center;">
  But that <strong><em>IS</em></strong> what this last stretch is always about, so better get to shopping while you can.
</p>

<p style="text-align: center;">
  Of course, that means that it is also the turn of my games to be on sale, so <em><strong>HERE WE GO!~</strong></em>
</p>

<p style="text-align: center;">
  Linking you directly to the storefronts of <strong>KNIGHTS</strong> and <strong>PEG</strong> would be boring, so instead hear me out.
</p>

<p style="text-align: center;">
  Recently new bundles were added in-Steam for a greater discount between other puzzle developers and me (all $1 games) that <em><strong>ACTUALLY STACKS WITH SALES!</strong></em>
</p>

<p style="text-align: center;">
  So great, and cheap minimalist puzzle games for you, or to give away, below the price of a coffee. So don&#8217;t miss this out, and HAPPY HOLIDAYS!

  Short post, so you can go back with your family and enjoy the holidays.
