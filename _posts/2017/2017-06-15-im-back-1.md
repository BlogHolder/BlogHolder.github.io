Where have I been? That is the question probably nobody asked an answer for, but I still felt like posting it.

For the last few months I was doing my professional service over at <a href="http://www.lienzo.mx/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Lienzo</a>, (low-key, these folks are amazing and you should check them out) and helping a little with their upcoming multi-platform game <a href="http://store.steampowered.com/app/623640/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Mulaka</a> (I do mean a little here, as they&#8217;ve been working on the game for quite some time now) and worked from start to finish on the mobile game <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.negas.lataman" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Lataman</a> for the mexican youtuber <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCcEww0gS4RxgtLf2h_SuVUw" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">NEGAS</a>. So in few words, I was busy helping with whatever I could on the development of those games. Was it worth it? Totally, not only on a programming techniques standpoint but also with development-experience level. It was an incredible professional service, that is all I want to say about that.

So <a href="/peg-demo-android/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">PEG</a>, that was totally a thing I was working on, totally not slacking off with it&#8230;

Basically, PEG is complete from a visual and functional standpoint, visible on the <a href="/peg-demo-android/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">demo</a>.

So what is left to do? Still have to prepare the different boards the game has, by setting the movement paths and other things:

Prepare boards, implement the menus, test the level progression curve and implement achievements those are the things that PEG needs to have before being completed. It isn&#8217;t actually that much as I said, pretty much all of the PEG-specific coding has already been implemented. So do expect this little project to hit the Steam Direct program in maybe the upcoming week.

&nbsp;

That is all I wanted to say, a little heads up for you one or two that like to read this.

But regardless, I&#8217;m grateful to that one or two, so thank you for reading my blog :3
