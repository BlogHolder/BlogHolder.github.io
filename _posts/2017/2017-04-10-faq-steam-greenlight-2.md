This is but an update message to let people know that more questions from the <a href="/faq-pt1/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">About Steam Greenlight F.A.Q.</a> has been updated.

Namely, it now includes the answers to the following questions:

  * What did you do to get Greenlit?
  * What are the requirements to upload at Greenlight
  * Are there any things to consider about Greenlight
  * How hard is to get Greenlit?
  * How many upvotes do we need to get Greenlit?
  * Is there a time limit to get past Greenlight?

So if you are interested in what has been answered so far, do check it out.

There are still some questions that need to be answered, so do wait for another update to the F.A.Q.

That is all I wanted to say at the moment, so for now, thank you very much for reading my blog~ :3
