I&#8217;m not sure if this was clear from the beginning, but _**I intend PEG to be the first game I make that has no text other than the game name on the title screen.**_

That intention comes all the way back from when I made <a href="/knights-over-100/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">KNIGHTS</a>, but in the end I was _unable to explain some of the mechanics without the use of text in the help button or some settings with just images_. So in a way, I was always disappointed on that aspect of the game.

It was only natural though, as I lacked the experience to fully make said graphics or the animations required to explained what was going on. (Did you think KNIGHTS_ **wasn&#8217;t**_ an animated game on purpose? Nope, just me not knowing a thing about animating).

That said, I&#8217;m very happy to see how everything is turning out.

And no, I haven&#8217;t just been making a settings menu this whole time, you will see soon.

Forward to my first text-less game!
