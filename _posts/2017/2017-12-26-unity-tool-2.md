## The Neat Tool From PC, Now On Your Unity Scene Editor

<p style="text-align: center;">
  We all have to make a note from time to time, especially if we are prone to forgetting things from one minute to the next. And when making games that isn&#8217;t the exception, as <em>you are likely to <strong>forget</strong> to fix some bug, finish setting up a scene, or which wall had a secret behind it.</em>
</p>

<p style="text-align: center;">
  So, <em><strong>what if you could have little post it notes directly in your Unity Scene?</strong></em> Well, today is the day you can do just that.
</p>

<p style="text-align: center;">
  A <em>To-DO list</em>, as <em>a way of marking places with <strong>bugs</strong></em>, or even as an <em>idea list</em>, you can now write down anything you need. And the best part is, these notes mark themselves as &#8220;EditorOnly&#8221;, so <em><strong>they will be ignored from builds</strong></em>, esentially auto-cleaning themselves!

</p>

<p style="text-align: center;">

<p style="text-align: center;">
  Letting you know that what you just read about, was <em><strong>ONE of several</strong> <strong>FREE</strong></em> tools that you can get on the <a href="https://github.com/heisarzola/Unity-Development-Tools" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Unity Development Tools Repository</a>. Again, they are <em><strong>FREE</strong></em> so just go see them, there are neat things in there ðŸ™‚
</p>

<p style="text-align: center;">
  That is all for today, a small treat for all you game developers out there. If you want to share what you did, feel free to do so, that would be lovely!
