So I thought it would be fun to have my own font, sorta like an ancient language to use in whatever I made for secret commentaries and messages for me to put around.

I used a [free font creator](http://www.myscriptfont.com/) to make it a .otf/.ttf from what I drew in Illustrator and then made something quick with the font in Photoshop (I&#8217;m far from honed in Photoshop as some can see).

It is far from final as the online font creator left some smudges on my vectors, but as a version 1 font it isn&#8217;t half bad.

â€¦ What? Are you expecting me to tell what the message says? That would be no fun.

I don&#8217;t expect anyone to crack it either (at least not from this one message) so there you go, leaving you with the doubt. :3
