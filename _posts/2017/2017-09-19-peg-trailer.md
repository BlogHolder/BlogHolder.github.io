There was <a href="/peg-is-hitting-steam/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">a post yesterday</a> regarding the fact that PEG now has a Steam page, but today the intention is to focus on an aspect of it, the trailer:

&nbsp;

<span class="embed-youtube" style="text-align:center; display: block;"></span>

&nbsp;

To anyone that reads it there is but a question I want to ask you, **what do you think of it**? Did you like it? Disliked it? What did you like? What did you dislike?

For this matter, feel free to drop any feedback on <a href="https://twitter.com/heisarzola" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Twitter</a>, <a href="https://www.facebook.com/heisarzola/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Facebook</a>, as a mail to _**contact@heisarzola.com**_ or just down below on the comment section. Every bit of information is appreciated.

The main focus from here until two weeks will be that of polishing the game before release, so it is better if the parts of the store page are done ASAP, reason feedback was asked.

&nbsp;

On a side note, I wanted to revamp the website to accommodate all titles I make from here on out, but I have to focus on the game itself first. So here is <a href="/PEG/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">a little something put together really fast as a dummy website for PEG.</a> A little random, I know, but I enjoy that randomness. And at least now those that visit the trailer page have something to see.

&nbsp;

That is all for now. So thank you for reading my blog.~

And for the fact that after over a year now, I&#8217;m still able to do these kinds of things, another big THANK YOU :3
