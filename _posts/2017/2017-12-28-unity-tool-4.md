## Coding Your Animations Has Never Been Easier

<a href="https://github.com/heisarzola/Unity-Development-Tools/tree/master/Attributes/Animator%20Parameter" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-elementor-open-lightbox="default"><br /> <img src="/images/posts/2017/12/Unity-Tools-6-Animator-Parameter-Text.gif" alt=""   data-recalc-dims="1" /> </a>

<p style="text-align: center;">
  If you are making a game with some level of complexity, chances are you ended up using <a href="https://docs.unity3d.com/462/Documentation/Manual/MecanimAnimationSystem.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Unity&#8217;s Mechanim Animation System</a>.
</p>

<p style="text-align: center;">
  If so, then you might also have noticed that <em>in order for the animations to blend or change into one another, you need to change <strong>animator parameter</strong><strong> values</strong></em> to do so.
</p>

<p style="text-align: center;">
  The problem is that to identify them, you need to provide a the <em><strong>CASE SENSITIVE</strong></em> string name you gave them. And if you aren&#8217;t careful and<em> make a typo, or the parameter has an empty space at the end you didn&#8217;t see</em>, well then you are going to have a bad day.
</p>

<p style="text-align: center;">
  This is a tool that is focused on preventing that, by providing a drop-down list of all valid parameter names from an Animator. So no need to manually type in anything.
</p>

<p style="text-align: center;">
  Without further ado, here you go. Enjoy~
</p>
