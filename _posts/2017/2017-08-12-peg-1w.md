Just a little quick (important) update.

<a href="/new-project-peg/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">PEG</a>, the project that has been in my development hell for quite some time now, is one week away from being completed. (Functionally speaking)

[<img class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-600" src="/images/posts/2017/08/Title-Screen.gif" alt=""   />](/images/posts/2017/08/Title-Screen.gif)

It will be $1 and will come to both mobile and PC (as soon as each store approves it of course). Do wait for an achievement and virtual goodies list soon.~

Almost folks, it is almost the time.

It has been quite the story with this title, given how I mostly spent my work time making a game framework behind the scenes to ease the workload on future titles. (Which ironically gave PEG a really unnecessarily long development time) But the tools I ended up with were totally worth the hassle.

I&#8217;ll be working really hard for this to work flawlessly so we can move on to the next thing soon :3

&nbsp;

I hope at least one soul expects this release as much as I&#8217;ve waited for it.

And if you are that one soul, thank you, and also thank you very much for reading my blog ðŸ™‚
