Audio is one of those things any game that is made will inevitably need to incorporate one way or another (unless it is just that extravagant of a game idea). So if you are one of those that plan on making several games, might as well make a good system that can be easily _**reusable**_ between projects.

Telling you how to handle sound in a game is a _very broad_ _area to cover_, as it most likely will vary greatly on a per project basis. But in my case, I felt that for the time being having different _**audio mixers**_ up and running for the different types of audios I wanted to play was enough.

Now, this is a good time to tell you that there are very good and official Unity tutorials over <a href="https://unity3d.com/learn/tutorials/modules/beginner/5-pre-order-beta/audiomixer-and-audiomixer-groups" target="_blank" rel="noopener">what Audio Mixers are</a> and <a href="https://unity3d.com/learn/tutorials/topics/audio/exposed-audiomixer-parameters" target="_blank" rel="noopener">how to work with them code-wise</a>, but I wanted to talk about a little piece of information that was missing from said tutorials, the fact that audio is managed as a _**logarithmic value**_.

You see, the way you can manipulate the audio of a mixer group is directly, you tell the mixer at what dB (decibel) value it should stay. While 0 dB does mean &#8220;normal&#8221; audio volume, and -80 dB is &#8220;mute&#8221;, what human ears perceive as the middle ground between normal and mute_ **ISN&#8217;T -40 dB**_. So if you were to make a slider like any of the ones shown above, you wouldn&#8217;t want that 0.5 was equal to setting that audio mixer to -40, or 0.25 to -60. Instead you should be using these formulas:

For converting from linear values (L) to DB:

  * If &#8220;L&#8221; < 0.0001, dB should be 80
  * If &#8220;L&#8221; > 1, dB should be 0 (Or you can ignore this if you want values up to 20 dB)
  * Or if &#8220;L&#8221; is between said values: dB = Mathf.Log10(linear) * 20f

Because of this formula is the reason you should want to keep 0.0001 < &#8220;L&#8221; < 1, as that is the way to achieve a range of values between -80 dB and 0 dB using the formula.

And, the opposite operation can be done to convert dB to &#8220;L&#8221;:

  * If dB < 80, &#8220;L&#8221; should be 0.0001
  * If dB > 0 80, &#8220;L&#8221; should be 1 (Again, this isn&#8217;t the case if you want to use up to 20 dB)
  * Or ifÂ  dB is between said values: L = Mathf.Pow(10.0f, dB / 20.0f);

And congratulations, now you know how to make audio sliders that actually work as they should. And if you think that using these formulas isn&#8217;t needed at all, try to make a slider that can move between -80 and 0 and move it around. You will notice that when near the &#8220;0&#8221; end of the slider, it is still being heard pretty loud, and when close to &#8220;1&#8221; the changes are a little more drastic.

Pair up this little piece of audio settings trivia with the tutorials shown above and you are on your way to make a system similar or way better than what I did.

And finally, as always, thank you very much for making it this far, and for reading my blog ðŸ˜€
