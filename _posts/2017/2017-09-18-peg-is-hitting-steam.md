<p style="text-align: left;">
  After a good time in my own game development purgatory, PEG is nearly hitting Steam :3
</p>

The official release date will be that of the first days of October, maybe 2 or 3, but it will be during those days for sure. _**There will be a special discount for those that grab the game early or that already own [KNIGHTS](http://store.steampowered.com/app/476240/).**_ So make sure to_ **add to your wish-list**_ if you don&#8217;t want to miss out!

_Â _

The game is not yet released, but really, a big thank you to everyone over the past year. Had there been no support, feedback or any sort of reaction from anyone, I don&#8217;t think I would be doing this today.

Thank you everyone. We&#8217;ll see each other again in MONOBOX.

&nbsp;

And a big thanks to YOU, for reading my blog ðŸ™‚
