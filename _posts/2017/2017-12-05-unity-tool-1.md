Be sure to check them out.
</p>

  Scriptable Objects are one of those things that once you know them, you will try to incorporate them for any module you are working on.
</p>

<p style="text-align: center;">
  But if that is the case, then you are likely to have dozens of them that you can make. After a certain number it just becomes just unpractical to make a create asset menu for each, so that is where this little tool comes in.
