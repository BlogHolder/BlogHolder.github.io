Just like the time when it came to **<a href="/knights-steam-achievements/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">KNIGHTS</a>**Â here are all the _achievements_ that will be included for all different platforms the game will be released in.

Do expect the **_PC, Android and iOS_** (yes, there will be iOS version this time around :D) updates in a post during mid September.

Like the last time, the list of achievements isn&#8217;t exactly super challenging or that unique and creative, but they do _**help me** **measure** **just how much people play and up to what point.**_ Plus, it also gives me the chance to give _nice icons_ for people to use on profiles (like in Steam), or _exp_ like in the case of Android&#8217;s Google Play Services. So it is a win-win situation ðŸ™‚

There are more achievements this time, and here is the list:

[<img class="aligncenter wp-image-605 size-full" src="/images/posts/2017/08/PEG-Achievements.png" alt=""   />](/images/posts/2017/08/PEG-Achievements.png)

It sometimes surprises me how it takes longer to build the icon or come up with an achievement name or idea than actually implementing it :B, but I suppose that is how it goes sometimes.

That is the little piece of PEG I wanted to show this time, but** _the game is nearly in stores_**, so stay tuned~

And like always, thank you very much for reading my blog :3
