[<img class="size-large wp-image-438 alignleft" src="/images/posts/2016/12/KNIGHTS-Google-Play-Achievements-UI.png" alt=""   />](/images/posts/2016/12/KNIGHTS-Google-Play-Achievements-UI.png)Given how I can see this achievement list in-game, I think it is safe to say the_ **Google Play**_ integration is done.

It took me around a day to get to know it and implement the achievements on the platform, and another day to adapt my save file system to that of the Google_ **cloud save**_ system. (And to get the actual thing to work&#8230;)

But now that I see it finished, I think it was worth the hazzle. The game will have the _**100, 000 exp**_ (max available per game) in_ **Google Play achievements**_ (for those that enjoy them) that once again, are the [same as on steam](/devblog/knights-steam-achievements/). And _**cloud saving**_, for those that have more than one device.

&nbsp;

I have no idea how long it takes to authorize one game to be on the shop, so once I upload the final screenshots and get all the achievements (for the 4th time, 1st on cellphone though) tomorrow, I think _**my work with the port will be over**_.
