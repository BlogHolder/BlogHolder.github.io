&nbsp;

The only thing left is to implement the Google Play sdk. (Be patient&#8230; almost had to redo the whole game&#8230; [Never go for a build & fix approach when making games kids.])

But yea, I just tested it and it works like a charm, it only needs some audio tweaks and minor changes here and there, but it will be a thing soon.

A short post this time, but even so, thank you for reading it. ;D
