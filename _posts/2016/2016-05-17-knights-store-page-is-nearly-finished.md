Man, it does feel good to see this taking shape and nearly finished.

If the testing, documentation and upload process goes smoothly, KNIGHTS should be launching by next Monday.

As stated before it will come packed with steam cards, emoticons, backgrounds and badges (which are actually being reviewed right now) and some other features such as steam sync and achievements. All for the low low price of $1 or your regional equivalent~ (Yea, $1 is the lowest games can go for)

Oh but early birds will get an extra discount during the first week~ In case the game isn&#8217;t cheap enough ðŸ˜›

Regardless, I couldn&#8217;t feel more flattered by all this, hopefully this will be the first of many games.

Thank you once more to everyone that supported this project and is making this possible.

And of course, to everyone that keeps reading my blog~ ðŸ™‚
