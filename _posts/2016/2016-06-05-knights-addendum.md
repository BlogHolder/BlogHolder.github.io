The first week of sales for <a href="http://store.steampowered.com/app/476240/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong>KNIGHTS</strong></a> went extremely well, in fact I never expected them to be this good o-o&#8221;.

So far the reactions, feedback and overall comments I&#8217;ve received are overwhelming. So thank to you everyone that was part of the journey until now.

&nbsp;

<a href="http://store.steampowered.com/app/476240/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong>KNIGHTS</strong></a> is unworthy of a GOTY award, it isn&#8217;t your next Undertale, and it will be far from your first option to kill time. I&#8217;m aware of that, but it is nice to see it has caused some impact. (And the fixed income is very nice too, not going to lie there.)

&nbsp;

So, even if this **sites** aren&#8217;t well-known, or if the content of these pages were cookie cut from my store page, my website or some template. It is still nice to think that someone, spent time making them, because that means that I was able to leave a tiny mark somewhere.

These might seem worthless to many, but mean a lot to me.

All that it has been and will be has been pretty much covered already, so there is no point on posting over it. Other than for the mobile releases and some reviews that is.

&nbsp;

The next posts should now start covering <span style="text-decoration: underline;">another project</span> that should be _finished soon_ actually. And a _third one_ on which I&#8217;m still working hard on the shadows&#8230; (When I&#8217;m not sleeping)

Who knows how that one will turn out though.

&nbsp;

Thank you to everyone I know it has been said many times, but every time it is meant it.

Thank you.
