So I stumbled with a little problem when testing the (now complete) version of KNIGHTS on Android. Don&#8217;t worry it doesn&#8217;t have anything to do with the game itself, but more with the cellphone I&#8217;m using that doesn&#8217;t like to be recognized when plugged&#8230;

So long story short, my new One Plus 3 (excellent phone, nothing against it) cannot be plugged to a PC the conventional way because the drivers don&#8217;t automatically install when being connected. (I can &#8220;run&#8221; them but nothing happens.)

I someone managed to find a workaround, but it came with a little cost:

(No I didn&#8217;t blew my PC, but I had to clean it.)

I kept all my files so the port is _**safe**_, but it will take me a while to _reinstall all my goodies._ (Pretty much leave them overnight + some time to manually install and sort).

Anyway, just wanted to throw that out there.

Moral of the story&#8230; don&#8217;t mess with your drivers unless you know what you are doing.

And I guess that&#8217;s it.

Thank you for reading~ ;D
