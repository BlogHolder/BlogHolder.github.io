Little Room will be a short free to play light-hearted atmospheric game that will talk about never ending cycles and decisions, it should be available to the public soon enough, given the short length it is intended to have.

This little project is also intended to test out some scripts, as well as to give some use to a couple of assets made a while ago that have been collecting dust. However, do note there is no intention to rush the project, it is a game that will receive the time it demands.

The screenshot might not show a lot right now, maybe it even feels a little empty. But so far so good if I do say so myself. Can&#8217;t wait to see how it turns out with all the final assets put together and moving.

That is all for now, but as always&#8230;

Thank you for reading my blog :3
