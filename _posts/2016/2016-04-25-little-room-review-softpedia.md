  Yesterday, <a href="/little-room-is-free-to-download-on-itch-io/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Little Room became available to download for free</a>. Some downloads were expected, given it got front-paged to the &#8220;new&#8221; section in <a href="https://arzola.itch.io/little-room" target="_blank" rel="noopener">itch.io</a> after it became available to public.

  To my surprise, after a couple of hours I received an email I wasn&#8217;t actually expecting:

>   Little Room, one of your products, has been added to Softpedia&#8217;s database<br /> of games and gaming tools. It is featured with a description text,<br /> screenshots, download links and technical details on this page:<br /> <a href="http://games.softpedia.com/get/Freeware-Games/Little-Room.shtml" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">http://games.softpedia.com/<wbr />get/Freeware-Games/Little-<wbr />Room.shtml</a>

  At first I thought the one that sent the email simply uploaded the game to their website without my permission. But once I opened the link, wow was I wrong:

>     Little Room is not your typical game, at least not from a gameplay point of view. It features mechanics that have been extinct ever since text-based adventure game were around, but it should be of little consequence in the grand scheme of things. In essence, this is a game that encourages you to dream and enjoy your life as much as possible.

>     It all begins in a room with a clock, a plant and a window. Not much is known about the main character, and it fact it would seem like she doesnâ€™t know very much about herself either. Your goal is to look around the room and find a way to more forward, which is actually a recurring theme in the game. To do so, you have to type specific commands in the text box and wait for the results.

  This is but a fragment of the review, but as I kept reading I was amazed by how someone else described the little game I made.
</p>

<p class="mgbot_10">
  I&#8217;m not going to lie, I was angry at the beginning for not asking for my permission from the start.
</p>

<p class="mgbot_10">
  But my did they persuade me with their writing. Not only am I flattered, but I&#8217;m glad that someone got to enjoy Little Room.

There is actually no other reason for this post other than to showcase this <a href="http://games.softpedia.com/get/Freeware-Games/Little-Room.shtml" target="_blank" rel="noopener">fantastic review</a>.
