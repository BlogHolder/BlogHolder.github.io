So I haven&#8217;t posted anything in a while and the reason for that is a combination between school, weird life situations, one time transactions (legal stuff) and purchases regarding future projects, and the fact that I&#8217;ve been working on a base framework for said projects.

&nbsp;

Nothing super fancy, but it will contain all the things a game editor should have. An independent save file system, debug options, and&#8230; I&#8217;m getting off track here.

&nbsp;

My point here is that I&#8217;ll try to post more often, not because of people demanding posts (as really, there are none). But in order for me to have a record of progress over the next years, I&#8217;ll keep posting. Who knows, someone might find it useful along the line.

<div id="attachment_406" style="max-width: 310px" class="wp-caption alignleft">
  <a href="/PEG/Animation/PEG.zip" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><img class="wp-image-406 size-full" src="/images/posts/2016/12/PEG.png" alt="peg"   /></a>
  
  <p class="wp-caption-text">
    <em><strong> (Don&#8217;t click this if you are on mobile.)</strong></em>
  </p>
</div>

And well&#8230; On other news I made a thing of the next project I want to launch before next year.

&nbsp;

But yea, there was really no purpose on posting other than giving out that message: &#8220;I&#8217;m still alive~&#8221;

&nbsp;

Regardless, thank you to everyone that has helped me get this far.

And to you, for reading my blog. ;3
