A little sneak peek on the achievements that will come with the game.

I always liked the concept of achievements, but never liked how they were sometimes insanely impossible or unnecessarily hard to get =|.

That&#8217;s why I decided mines wouldn&#8217;t be the easiest from the bunch to get, but still humanly doable if you wish to get them all.

So, here they are:

Everything is going smoothly, soon enough beta testers will get their keys.

(You know who you are :P)

Anyway, that is all for now~

And always, thank you for reading my blog~ ðŸ™‚
