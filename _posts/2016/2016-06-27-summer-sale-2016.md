This might be a little late to report, but it is that time of the year again&#8230;

&nbsp;

<a href="http://store.steampowered.com/app/476240/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><img class="aligncenter wp-image-314 size-full" src="/images/posts/2016/06/Steam-Sumer-Sale-2016-2.png"   /></a>

**<span style="text-decoration: underline;">OHH YEAA!</span>** It is that time of the year again, when we spend our hard-earned money _mindlessly_ purchasing more games than one life allows to play.

It is even more exciting for me this year as it will be the first time I will be taking part as a _developer_. I don&#8217;t really had to do much besides choosing a price tag for the game, but still it is an interesting experience.

&nbsp;

And you know what phrase comes to mind on these dates&#8230; come on&#8230; I don&#8217;t even have to remind you&#8230;

</p>

  * [Steam](http://store.steampowered.com/app/476240/) (20% discount)
  * [itch.io](https://arzola.itch.io/knights) (25% discount)
  * [Website](/KNIGHTS/) (25% discount)

&nbsp;

If you wish to ask me why it is cheaper on some places rather than having all the same discount, the reason is&#8230; _taxes_. ðŸ˜›

Let us hope that by the Holiday Sales I have more games to offer to everyone ðŸ™‚

&nbsp;

Once again, thank you everyone!

And as always, thank you for reading my blog. :3
