Tomorrow is the big day, KNIGHTS will finally **launch to the public**.

Regardless of how things go this will be but a step that needs to be taken in order to finally start in the world that is game development.

&nbsp;

That said, the <a href="/KNIGHTS/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">official game site</a> received a little coat of painting to commemorate the occasion.

Notice something new? Just a little hint here&#8230;

Ta da~ Now there are more places to get the game, and that number will sure increase soon. I do hope that Android, Tablets and iPhone download links join this section by next month.

(On a side note, there will be a discount sale for the whole launch week~)

&nbsp;

Once again, thank you to everyone that allowed this to happen.

I am very grateful for everything that has happened both good and bad. That I actually started making something I could be proud of saying I made, and that others actually want to try out as well.

&nbsp;

Months ago I would have never thought of getting requests for reviews, invitations to join game websites, to be invited into competitions, or suggestions to join certain stores.

It has really been quite the roller coaster.

&nbsp;

Thank you.
