This will be the first post of the already in development (and near final build) game KNIGHTS! :3

<a href="/KNIGHTS/" rel="attachment wp-att-25"><img class="size-medium wp-image-25 alignleft" src="/images/posts/2016/03/Knights-GIF.png" alt="KNIGHTS-Icon"   /></a>

KNIGHTS is a minimalistic puzzle game based on a single chess piece, the titular knight. A simple enough to pick up and relaxing experience.

The goal for each level is to set each of the colored knights into a space of their corresponding color. Forethought and future planning are key abilities to master for later puzzles. New ways to tackle a problem will gradually evident as the game progresses, allowing several solutions for the same puzzle.

For more information please do visit the <a href="/KNIGHTS/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">official game page</a>.
