Some might be wondering, &#8220;What is Greenlight&#8221;?

For a close to completion or already finished game, greenlight refers to the process of approval for its sale on a certain platform. Not only consoles, but PC and phone games usually have to go through this phase, to serve as a type of quality filter.Â  In this particular case, it is <a href="http://steamcommunity.com/greenlight/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Steam&#8217;s Greenlight</a> that takes the spotlight.

Right now it is up to the Steam community itself to get this game to the store, by grading it with either a thumbs up or downvote.

So far the reception of the game has been fantastic, thank you to everyone that has voted and/or commented!

Regardless of how the campaign goes from here on, the game WILL make it to Steam eventually, so again, thank you very much.

And also, thank you for reading from my blog.
