Many people claim that the overallÂ aesthetic of a project can be as definitive as their functionality, when it comes to liking or using it.

<a href="/images/posts/2016/03/Paper-Mario-Pixel-Art.png" target="_blank" rel="attachment wp-att-100"><img class="alignright wp-image-100 size-medium" src="/images/posts/2016/03/Paper-Mario-Pixel-Art.png" alt="Paper Mario Pixel Art"   /></a>When it comes to games, there are several art styles that people can immediately relate to or at the very least identify. Such as minimalistic, &#8220;mobile/flash&#8221; (which generally is vector art), realistic, toon (cell shading), hand drawn, and the incredibly hard to make pixel art.

As expected, pixel art is a literal interpretation of the phrase, where the making of each asset depends on the edit of each of the individual cells that compose an image, or &#8220;pixels&#8221;. It can be as tedious as it sounds, not mentioning that making a credible interpretation of anything in pixels is quite hard on its own. But it can be a nightmare if the size of the finished product is wrong. On the early days, it would mean to remake the whole image again, so it was very easy to mess up.

Today however, we count with different solutions to this problem, such as <a href="https://code.google.com/archive/p/2dimagefilter/downloads" target="_blank">Hawkynt&#8217;s Image Resizer</a>.
