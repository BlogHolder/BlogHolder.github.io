  <em><strong>~I AM FEELING&#8230; DREAMY~</strong></em>
</p>

A new, completely free to play game is already in development. It will be called &#8220;Little Room&#8221;, and will be based around a similar concept of that of P.T. (without the horror elements). The core concept will be exploring the same room over and over, while paying attention to how said room gradually changes.

The message it will try to deliver will be kept secret for now, however it will keep a light-hearted atmosphere for everyone to enjoy. A short, simple, yet interesting little tale.

For more information, stay tuned.

And as always, thank you for reading~
