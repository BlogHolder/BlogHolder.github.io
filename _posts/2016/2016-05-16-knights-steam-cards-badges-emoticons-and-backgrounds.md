Just like several other platforms, Steam tries to offer a little extra to their games and platform to increase the overall customer experience. Such services can be cloud sync, achievements, controller support and a customizable profile. The latter offers developers the ability to create several items that can be displayed and/or used on the platform.

KNIGHTS hasn&#8217;t arrived to Steam yet, but all the preparations for trading cards have been completed.

&nbsp;

Now, let us display all the items this involves:
