The final block before having KNIGHTS live on the store page has been removed!

[<img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-231" src="/images/posts/2016/05/Store-Ready.png" alt="Store Ready"   />](/images/posts/2016/05/Store-Ready.png)

Basically as soon as this button is pressed the game will launch, but because of the &#8220;Weekly Deals&#8221; and releases that Steam has every MondayÂ  _**it might be best to release on the 30th**_.

That said, during the past weeks promo screenshots were made for the game (which I should have honestly done since the beginning), but here they are:

Nothing outstanding, but _WAY_ better than plain screenshots.

&nbsp;

This is the first commercial project that I have released to the public _(already working on a second one)_, but before moving forward it would be best to see what feedback and recommendations KNIGHTS gets, and then **_launch it on mobile_**.

Already have the game, might as well spend some days putting it on as many platforms and before the largest audience as possible.

&nbsp;

As for the before mentioned second project, lets leave it at I&#8217;m working with _&#8220;paper&#8221;_. (You will know soon enough)

&nbsp;

This was a little message I wanted to spread the word about, and guess that is all for now.

But as always,

Thank you very much for reading my blog ðŸ™‚
