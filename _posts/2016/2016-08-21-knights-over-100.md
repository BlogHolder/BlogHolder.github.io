It has been a while, hasn&#8217;t it?

Some troubling things happened, but it should all go uphill from here. So time to get dirty with work again.~

&nbsp;

I know it was said [KNIGHTS](http://steamcommunity.com/app/476240/) posts would be over unless something relevant happened with the game. But guess what? _It_ happened:

&nbsp;

<a href="/images/posts/2016/08/KNIGHTS-Over-100-Reviews.png" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><img class="aligncenter wp-image-371 size-full" src="/images/posts/2016/08/KNIGHTS-Over-100-Reviews.png" alt=" KNIGHTS Over 100 Reviews"   /></a>

_**HOLY COW!**_ Those are the only words I could come up with in this situation.

[Over a hundred people](http://steamcommunity.com/app/476240/reviews/?filterLanguage=all#scrollTop=0) liked the game enough to review it, and on top of that&#8230; just look at that like/dislike ratio&#8230;

&nbsp;

I understand there are games with hundreds of thousands of positive reviews. But you should also know that there can _easily_ also be thousands of games with less than a dozen positive reviews for each of those &#8220;successful games&#8221;. So truly, it is something to be grateful for.

Next milestone:

  * **Overwhelmingly Positive:** 500+ reviews with a 95%+ positive score. (I know we can.)

&nbsp;

Thank you.

&nbsp;

One can only get so far alone. So I thank you, I mean it.

_The game is selling very well_ even without any sort of discount or big updates, and that is a huge incentive to keep working.

&nbsp;

A big shout-out to everyone that also sent e-mails just to wish the best for the game and future projects.

&nbsp;

And as I said it to those that cleared the game:

[<img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-372" src="/images/posts/2016/08/Let-this-be-the-beginning-of-more-to-come..jpg" alt="Let this be the beginning of more to come."   />](/images/posts/2016/08/Let-this-be-the-beginning-of-more-to-come..jpg)

So, one final time.

**Thank you** for giving me this chance.
