Let&#8217;s handle this one platform at a time, shall we?

The spotlight today goes for itch.io!

<a href="https://arzola.itch.io/knights" rel="attachment wp-att-116"><img class="aligncenter size-medium wp-image-116" src="/images/posts/2016/03/itch.png" alt="itch"   /></a>

Itch.io is a great place for both commercial and non commercial games alike, and home to plenty of game jams creations (games usually done in a couple of days). So you might want to check it out for some entertaining titles.

<a href="https://arzola.itch.io/knights" target="_blank" rel="noopener">KNIGHTS is currently available at a small discount for a limited time</a>, so be sure to check it out if you are interested~

Thank you for reading my blog, but especially, thank you for everyone that is making this possible :3
