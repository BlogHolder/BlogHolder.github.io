After over a week in development, the wait is finally over.

Little Room is finally complete~

&nbsp;

Just as a friendly reminder, the game will be free to play and available on all PC platforms.

It won&#8217;t be long until all the download links are up and running, so stay tuned.

&nbsp;

Making this second game has been quite the experience.

Not even I knew what I wanted to make out of it, and the week I made it in was interesting to say the least.

While in the making, I couldn&#8217;t help but make myself many questions, which actually molded the result.

&nbsp;

To some, it might not be the most cohesive story of the bunch, but I always liked things that were open to interpretation.

Hope that those who play it get something out of it, or that at least have a good time.

&nbsp;

And of course I also hope that this is another of more games to come.

As always, thank you for reading my blog.
