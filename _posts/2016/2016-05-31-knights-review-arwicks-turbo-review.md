Once again, having **KNIGHTS** finished came with a little surprise. First of all, _the game has been doing well on both <span style="text-decoration: underline;">sales</span> and <span style="text-decoration: underline;">reviews</span>_.

I&#8217;ve seen several games get bad reviews when they are first starting which affects their sales on the long run, so it is very nice to see **KNIGHTS** having such a good start.

&nbsp;

And secondly, today I got a message of a **reviewer** who gave his feedback on the game. He has some fair points I should consider adding or changing about the game, but it would be better if you see it for yourself. His pseudonym is Arwick, and he does something he likes to call &#8220;Turbo Reviews&#8221;:

<span class="embed-youtube" style="text-align:center; display: block;"></span>

Very happy with the results of that little project that was **KNIGHTS**, but it is time to _move forward_.

&nbsp;

I will soon post about the <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><em>next project</em></span>, it will be short, but interesting.

Honestly I don&#8217;t know where the inspiration came from for that project, you will see for yourself.

&nbsp;

Anyway, that is all for now.

Thank you very much for everyone&#8217;s support, it has been a blast!

And thank you too, for reading my blog :3~
