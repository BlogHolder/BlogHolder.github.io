Some weeks ago the folks from [Viope World](https://www.viope.com/) sent me an invitation to take part on an event they hold on a yearly basis.

<a href="https://thegdwc.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><img class="aligncenter wp-image-296 size-full" src="/images/posts/2016/06/GDWC-2016.png" alt="GDWC 2016"   /></a>

The [Game Development World Championship (or GDWC)](https://thegdwc.com/), a competition where any game finished in the current year can enter. And yes that is pretty much the only rule to fulfill, it _**HAS TO BE FROM THIS YEAR**_ (for obvious reasons).

<a href="http://www.nintendo.com/games/detail/LAq40ckHIzAT4T2FiFE1S29yTrO68YVz" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><img class="alignleft wp-image-298 size-medium" src="/images/posts/2016/06/DK-Jr.-Math.jpg" alt="DK Jr. Math"   /></a>The rest is basically if you wish to participate on either the _serious_ or _entertainment_ category. Where **serious** will be those projects that address a certain issue, mainly education. And **entertainment** the one most games will fall into, because let&#8217;s be honest here, that is the reason we play.

&nbsp;

Also, there is <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><em>no limit to the number of submissions or team members</em></span>, if they are done before September the 30th. So if you finish one project each week (somehow), you can still submit 16 projects before the timeline is here.

And before I forget, projects which by the way can be of _**any**_ platform: Mobile, PC, Mac, Linux, tablet, consoles, r-zone, you name it. Given you provide the correct build for the game that is.

So basically, if you finished a game recently, might as well <a href="https://thegdwc.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">upload it</a>. Nothing to lose, it is already finished after all.

&nbsp;

I&#8217;m not being paid to say this (why would someone pay **ME**?) but it is a public invitation for anyone that gets to see this post.

So if you read it this far, thank you, and I hope to see your project(s) participating!

And to those regulars,

Thank you, for reading my blog~ ðŸ˜€
