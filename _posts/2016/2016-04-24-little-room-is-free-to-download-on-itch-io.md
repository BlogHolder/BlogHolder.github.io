As said yesterday, <a href="/little-room-is-finished/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Little Room is finally finished</a>~

So it is time to happily announce it is now available to <a href="https://arzola.itch.io/little-room" target="_blank" rel="noopener">download for free at itch.io</a>.

&nbsp;

<a href="/images/posts/2016/04/Little-Room-Instructions.png" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><img class="wp-image-142 size-medium alignleft" src="/images/posts/2016/04/Little-Room-Instructions.png" alt="Little Room Instructions"   /></a>All you have to do is hit the &#8220;Download Now&#8221; button, and then you can download for the PC platform of your choice.

It will then appear like you have to pay, but that isn&#8217;t the case. You only have to press the &#8220;No thanks, just take me to downloads.&#8221; link.

Itch.io is home to several works done by many people for free, so this is why the website counts with a donation system. But that said, it isn&#8217;t a requirement to download anything.

&nbsp;

Feel free to support any developer you find in the site. (Yours truly included of course~ :3)

&nbsp;

As for instructions on how to play the game, well, I just hope it is intuitive enough for anyone to understand without me actually telling them.

&nbsp;

I really hope people enjoy it as much as I did once I finished it.

If it looks a little rushed, it is because it was developed in a little over a week, so it had a deadline to meet. But I still believe it gets the message across despite the short length.

&nbsp;

Regardless, once again, I hope you enjoy it.

And as always,

thank you for reading my blog ðŸ™‚
