All that is left before being released is to test the game, this is to tweak difficulty and overall user experience. However because of the game&#8217;s scope, it shouldn&#8217;t take long to get to the final pre-release build, so it will hit the stores soon enough. (PC, Android and iOs) Do notice that depending on the platform or distributor, the approval time varies, where it could take as little as a few days to a couple of months.

&nbsp;

The price of the game will be of $1 USD or the regional equivalent.

&nbsp;

It has been quite the ride, but the results were worth the work.

What will come after this? Another game of course, free this time. The before mentioned Little Evershifting Room for PC download, web (let&#8217;s just hope WebGL from Unity gets patched soon enough though >~<) and maybe even phones.

Thank you to everyone who gave their continued feedback and support.

&nbsp;

And as always, thank you for reading my blog.
